#Areal Density Integration with Voronoi Partitioning

This code demonstrates the area integration of densities sampled along a survey track using Voronoi diagrams. 
The example employs simulated data to represent the distribution of acoustically determined fish density for an abstract 
species category, 'FISH_SA'.

Two demonstration programs are provided:

- A Jupyter notebook presenting simple integration, located in *nangis/demo/notebook/Simple integration.ipynb*
- A GUI applet *nangis/demo/integrator_demo_app.py*
